# SpaceX Rocket Landing Intelligence Project Description

**SpaceX Rocket Landing Intelligence leverages machine learning algorithms to predict the success of rocket landings, a key factor in improving the reusability of rockets and reducing the overall cost of space missions. By analyzing historical launch data from SpaceX, the project builds and evaluates several classification models to forecast whether a rocket landing will be successful or fail.

**The project uses multiple machine learning algorithms including Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines (SVM), Decision Trees, and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) to predict landing outcomes based on various factors such as the rocketâ€™s specifications, launch site, and weather conditions.
